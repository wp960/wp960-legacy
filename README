This theme is designed to integrate the 960 grid system design principles into WordPress site design and maintenance.

This theme is currently limited to 960px width divided into 24 columns with 5 pixel margins on each column.
I hope to increase the flexibility by taking advantage of the fluid width abilities of the 960 framework and adding a width option to the theme options screen.

In it's current implimentation the home page consists of a page using the "widget page" template. Once you have selected this to be front page of the site in the reading options, you will have to apply grid_width CSS classes to any of the widgets you have placed within the home page widget area.
The plugin we currently use for this is: Widget Classes by aizatto http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-classes/

Once you have asigned these widgets to the home page container you will need to style them with CSS - no styling is provided by this framework.




If you use this theme; please report any issues so that we can continue to make this the definitive 960 grid theme for WordPress.
